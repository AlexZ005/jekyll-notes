## Jekyll-notes

Jekyll-notes is a Jekyll theme for managing notes. Simply clone to your GitHub Page

## Advantages

Contents are stored in _chapters folder and any subfolder and its files are automatically seen in submenu. The notes have to mantain yaml structure though, including three dashes and layout: default.

Menu automatically generates with subfolders, isn’t it neat?
